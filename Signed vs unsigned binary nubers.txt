An unsigned binary number can't show negative numbers. 
Lets use 4 bit numbers as an example.
1011 is equal to 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
0101 is equal to 4 + 0 + 1 = 5


Signed binary numbers uses the last bit (most significant bit)
to show if the number is negative or positive.

0 if positive
1 if negative

1011 becomes -1* (2+1) = 3
0101 is still 5 since first bit is 0


Pros:
Able to show negative numbers.
0 - 1 does not become a BIG positive number.

Cons: 
1 less bit is usable causing the maximum value
to be 50% of a unsigned number.






Why not always use large bit variables?
Large bit variables take more space and ram. Optimizing is important.
So instead of a True or False variable taking only a few bits, 1 maybe
It would take 128 bits.
